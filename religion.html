        <h1> religion in eleria:</h1>
        <p> religion in eleria varies wildly from place to place, but almost all elerians worship some religious system built around the same core gods and founding myths</p>
        <h1 id="gods"> gods/deities</h1>
        <p> the same seven deities are commonly referenced in eleria's religions: the six gods and "the arbiter." while the arbiter is often considered a higher power than the rest of the pantheon, most believe that the arbiter abandoned eleria immediately following <a href="religion#the_dividing_time">the dividing time</a>. outside of the arbiter, the six gods are generally worshipped at the same level, though there are certainly stronger shows of faith for some gods than others, depending on the region.  the six gods are often divided into "the flames and the forged," originally a reference to the visual depictions in the <a href="">dwarvish belief system</a> but now seen as a generally useful division.</p>
        <h3 id="arbiter"> the arbiter (N)</h3>
        <p> the arbiter is not a god, but an all-powerful deity. the creator of the world, the arbiter served as its protector and keeper for four hundred days during <a href="religion.html#the_dividing_time">the dividing time</a>, but is believed to not have exerted any influence on the world ever since. while most still believe it maintains its power, and could theoretically return, the nature of these beliefs depends on the sect, and none in any respected temple worship the arbiter. no cleric has receieved a response from it, so most think it has finished its job with eleria. its motives and origins are unknown.</p>
        <h2> the flames:</h2>
        <h3 id="ignaea"> ignaea: goddess and protector of the hearth (NG)</h3>
        <p> as the patron of <a href="guardians.html">the guardians</a> and <a href="hearth.html"> the hearth</a>, ignaea serves an especially important role, particularly in and around ezela. though she is not a military goddess, her temples are often connected to the <a href="guardians.html#pits">fighting pits and arenas</a> found around eleria. though there is no official head of the pantheon, if there were one, it would be ignaea. she is the most widely worshipped deity in eleria, and her arenas are a symbol of her that stand in nearly every town and city.</p>
        <h3 id="karoa"> karoa: god of the sun, of combat, of art (CG)</h3>
        <p> once the lover of <a href="religion.html#clia"> clia</a>, karoa was bound to the opposite side of the sky from him by the arbiter during <a href="religion.html#the_dividing_time">the dividing time</a>. out of the sadness and misery he felt for losing his beloved, karoa sang the first song, and became the patron of the arts in eleria. though he is recognized as the god of combat, he is more so the god of combat as an art. many performative combat styles are practiced in eleria, particularly in <a href="geography.html#talyen">talyen</a>, though <a href="religion.html#ignaea">ignaea</a> is seen more as the patron of combative conflict.</p>
        <h3 id="satya"> satya: god of life, of nature (CN)</h3>
        <p> as the god of life, satya brings up the sentient races of eleria, their livestock, and their crops, but also the terrifying horrors that approach from <a href="">the beyond</a>. this makes him generally popular in urban and agricultural areas as a sort of harvest god, but he is more feared than he is worshipped the farther from <a href="hearth.html">the hearth</a> you travel.</p>
        <h2> the forged:</h2>
        <h3 id="terra"> terra: goddess of the earth, of law (LN)</h3>
        <p> the ground of eleria is unforgiving. for miles and miles downwards, there is nothing but ice and snow, and for many more miles there is more of the same, but with occasional stone and ore. however, though the earth is harsh, it is free to use for all inhabitants of eleria, and so in the same way, the law should treat them all equally. terra holds these responsibilities equally, and is viewed as a symbol of equality.</p>
        <h3 id="clia"> clia: god of the moon, of invention, of knowledge (LG)</h3>
        <p> once the lover of <a href="religion.html#karoa"> karoa</a>, clia was bound to the opposite side of the sky from him by the arbiter during <a href="religion.html#the_dividing_time">the dividing time</a>. in his futile search to return to his lover, clia became the first artificer, devising any contraption that he believed he could use to return once again to karoa. following this, he became the patron of invention, a guiding hand and inspiring light to the artificers of eleria. many of his followers will sleep during the day and work by moonlight, hoping to be inspired by his gaze.</p>
        <h3 id="veya"> veya: goddess of arcane wonders (LE)</h3>
        <p> magic is generally frowned upon in religious circles, though its use is undeniably important in eleria. veya is the keeper of the aether, the source of arcane energy from which mages get their power. she is seen as a fierce protector of the aether, strictly ensuring that it is maintained, but never picking sides in battles fought with its power.</p>
        
        <h1 id="the_dividing_time">the dividing time</h1>
        <p> the first 400 days of the universe are labeled "the dividing time," representing the arbiter's division of the realm between the six gods. this period is the source of many of the myths common to all the different religious sects of eleria, and also the reason for the realm's 400 day calendar.</p>
        <p> according to legend, the arbiter brought the world into existence at the beginning of the dividing time, and vowed to place control of the world into the hands of the six gods he created within 400 days. at the time, the world was nothing but a flat, infinite expanse of ice and snow, with the hearth at its center. the arbiter allowed the gods to act independently for some time, to see what they would each take a liking to. on the seventy-seventh day, <a href="religion.html#clia">clia</a> and <a href="religion.html#karoa">karoa</a> took a liking to each other and came together in the first display of passion in the world. their love for one another caused them to ignite: clia, the brilliant white of the moon, karoa, the pale yellow of the sun. a cold and unfeeling deity, the arbiter disliked this show of love, and attempted to force the two apart. however, the arbiter could not think of a way to divide the two, and so it required <a href="religion.html#veya">veya's</a> help to achieve this. the two bound clia and karoa each to opposite sides of the sky so that they may never reunite. as a show of gratitude for her clever solution, the arbiter granted veya the aether, the source of magic and the arcane in eleria.</p>
        <p> on the two hundred and thirty-first day of the dividing time, <a href="religion.html#satya">satya</a> showed the arbiter his newest creation: a small tree, kept alive by the warmth of the hearth. the arbiter took a liking to his creations, and encouraged him to continue. satya populated the area around the hearth with small plants, flowers, and the first animals, mostly small rodents and insects. on the three hundredth day, satya created the first sentient beings (whose races are disputed between the different sects). the beings saw the hearth, and grew afraid of it. some of the beings decided to worship it, and live in awe of it, while the others feared it. those in fear began to charge towards the hearth, attempting to attack it and extinguish it, but <a href="religion.html#ignaea">ignaea</a> stood between them to protect the hearth, smiting down those who hoped to do away with its flame. for this, ignaea was named the protector of the hearth.</p>
        <p> by the three hundred and ninety-ninth day of the dividing time, the hearth had melted the ground below it until it was hundreds of miles below the surface. the arbiter feared that the hearth would fall through the bottom of the earth, so <a href="religion.html#terra">terra</a> created a pillar of stone beneath it and laid a foundation of rock beneath all in the realm, so that the bottom of the world would never be exposed. for this, she was named the goddess of the earth. </p>
        <p> on the four hundredth day of the dividing time, the arbiter declared that the realm was in good hands, and that there was no longer a need for its presence. the arbiter exited the realm, and has not been seen since. this marked the beginning of the first year, and since then, the world has laid entirely under the control of the gods.</p>

        <h1 id="sects"> religious sects</h1>
        <p> while interpretation of elerian religion varies from place to place, just about everyone worships the same pantheon. there are certainly non-religious people, and many people that aren't religious enough to justify considering themselves devotees of any given sect, but the three most popular and clearly defined approaches to religion are as follows:</p>
        <h2 id="azum"> azum</h2>
        <p> most popular in katis, azum is religion for the masses. worship occurs in congregations at temples under the guidance of a cleric, and a number of holy texts contain prayers, hymns, and parables passed down for generations. azumites take the most literal approach to religion, even building large statues or detailed paintings of the gods and attributing physical characteristics to them. in these depictions, <a href="religion.html#karoa">karoa</a>, <a href="religion.html#ignaea">ignaea</a>, and <a href="religion.html#satya">satya</a> are depicted as humanoid figures wreathed in flames, while <a href="religion.html#clia">clia</a>, <a href="religion.html#terra">terra</a>, and <a href="religion.html#veya">veya</a> are often depicted wrought of ice, stone, and steel, hence the division of the gods into "the flames and the forged."</p>
        <p> rituals in azum vary depending on the god they are dedicated to. rituals to terra may be as simple as a trial, but often take the form of a dignified public execution. satya is often worshipped with animal sacrifices, ignaea with combats, and in general the prayers raised to each god mirror that god's domain. </p>
        <h2 id="vehrti"> vehrti </h2>
        <p> vehrti is the dominant religion in talyen, and is far more spiritual in nature than azum. most vehrti see their primary connection to the gods through meditation and more private worship. there are certaintly congregations of vehrti, however these groups mainly meet for philosophical discussions about religion, rather than worship of the gods. unlike in azum, the gods are seen completely abstractly in vehrti religion; no physical characteristics are attributed to them in any way, they are just seen as ethereal forces in the world. </p>
        <p> combat is seen as a primary form of worship in vehrti religion. arenas are often designated as "ignaean" or "karoan," the former describing an arena for traditional combat, meant as training for those that will one day become guardians, and the latter describing an arena for a special performative form of combat common in talyen. these karoan fights are not held with the purpose of determining a victor, but are rather a form of dedication to karoa and the rest of the pantheon, seen as much as a fighting style as it is an art form. these fights are remarkably difficult to participate in, and are often considered the most beautiful spectacle seen anywhere in eleria.</p>
        <h2 id="shamanism"> shamanism</h2>
        <p> those from the beyond worship the same gods, but in a manner that in no way resembles any other religion. nowhere besides the hearth is there a clearer display of the presence of the gods, so while nonbelievers are present throughout eleria, there is no soul in the beyond that denies the gods' power. from satya's horrors to veya's blessings, the divine permeates every aspect of life in the beyond. while there is little in the way of organized religion, all inhabitants both revere and fear the gods. </p>
        <p> the highest officers of religion in the beyond are the shamans, who bend veya's aether to their desires to make life in the beyond possible. they are essential in both the defense and maintenace of the small villages that are scattered throughout the beyond, as spiritual leaders and as powerful mages.</p>
