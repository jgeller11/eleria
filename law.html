        <h1> law and government in eleria</h1>
        <p> ever since unification of eleria a few hundred years ago, there has been no monarch, though there is still certainly favored nobility. the government primarily operates courts and levies taxes; though they do not have full control over the guardians or <a href="misc.html#pebblerun>pebblerun</a>, they exert a strong influence on both.</p>
        <p> the government is headed by a high council in the talyen sector of ezela, composed of three delegations of equal power, one from each region. each region may send a delegation in any form of any size, but each region generally keeps their delegation in the same format. talyen typically sends a single ruler to the high council, while katis and iora each send a council of three.</p>
        <p> though the high council does levy taxes, enforce laws, and manage many important aspects of elerian life, particularly within ezela, most elerians feel more loyalty to and pressure from their reigonal governments. each region has its own government that has some restrictions placed on it by the high council, but can ultimately take any form. the talyen government is nearly monarchichal, exchanging the few positions of power between a few noble families that have risen from the ashes in <a href="geography.html#imra">imra</a>. the katis government is a democratically elected parliament, with each of thirty-one representatives appearing on behalf of a few constituents, and the ioran government is practically non-existent. though there is a hall in <a href="geography.html#gloughton">gloughton</a> for a few representatives from various towns to convene in, there are more unspoken rules in the region than there are strict laws, and so maintaining and updating the rules iorans follow is a process that happens naturally, and does not really require a government for any reason other than levying very small taxes and deciding which iorans should represent the region in the high council.</p>
        <p> trials are generally held before a judge, and occasionally a jury. they are often religious processes performed under the guidance of a priest of <a href="religion.html#terra">terra</a>, though not always. there are a few people who specifically study and practice law, but for all but the most high-profile cases, all parties represent themselves in court, and all is settled within an hour or two at most. </p>
