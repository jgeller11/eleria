        <h1> welcome to eleria</h1>
        <p> thousands and thousands of years ago, there was the arbiter, the gods, a flat expanse of ice and snow, and the hearth. the hearth is a gigantic flame that rages on eternally, giving heat, light, and life to all in eleria. over time, the hearth has melted the ground below it and burrowed a hole many miles deep into the ice, creating a pit roughly 500 miles in diameter and almost a thousand miles deep, which has become the home of eleria. as the hearth reveals the bedrock below it, it melts less and less of the ice immediately surrounding it, but the walls of the pit still shed fresh water, and the elerians have learned to control these waters. <a href="geography.html#floes">the floes</a> are three vast, precisely engineered swaths of eleria that, far away from the hearth, are covered in about an inch or two of flowing water. as the water approaches the hearth, however, it is directed into narrower and narrower channels, terminating in rushing rivers that flow into the hearth and evaporate off into the atmosphere, forming a column of steam rising up to the heavens, a testament to the hearth's power.</p>
        <p> the three floes divide eleria into three main regions: <a href="geography.html#katis">katis</a>, <a href="geography.html#iora">iora</a>, and <a href="geography.html#talyen">talyen</a>. each has its own demographics, traditions, and cultures, though all share a piece of <a href="geography.html#ezela">ezela</a>, the great city that surrounds the hearth on all sides. there in ezela, there is a vibrant mixing of cultures, an abundance of wealth and commerce, a devout community of believers, academies of the arts, the sciences, and the arcane, and anything else you could hope to find. </p>
        <p> travelling farther and farther into the city and towards the hearth, you will find greater and greater wealth, leading up to the <a href="geography.html#inner_city">inner city</a>: a gated portion of the city accessible only to those with a good reason to be there, or a hefty coin purse. within even the inner city, however, lies <a href="guardians.html#wardstone">wardstone</a>, the headquarters of the <a href="guardians.html#guardians">guardians</a>. the guardians are a combination of a police force and a militia (no conventional army is needed, since there is no other nation against which to fight). while guardians can be found throughout ezela and the rest of eleria, the most prestigious position is immediately surrounding the hearth. all inhabitants of eleria rely on the hearth to live in one way or another, so attacks against it must be soundly protected against. no one is sure how anyone would or why anyone might want to extinguish the hearth, but no one is willing to take a chance and let the hearth go without protection. as a further precaution against attacks, academic and arcane study of the hearth is strictly forbidden.</p>
        <p> travelling farther and farther away from the hearth in any direction, you will reach <a href="geography.html#the_beyond">the beyond</a>. the beyond is a loosely defined region far away from the hearth, where the population of people is sparse, but monsters, beasts, and horrors are abundant. there, people live in the shadow of the looming wall of ice that forms the rim of the valley above them, and so the sun is visible only for a few hours per day, depending on the exact positioning. many myths are spread about horrible creatures lurking within those shadows, but most from the more civilized world wouldn't be sure what to believe and what is merely a myth meant to scare little children.</p>
        <p> in iora, about 40 miles up along the shore of the floe that divides it from katis, lies a small town named <a href="geography.html#portswood">portswood</a>, where your adventure begins.</p>
