        <h1> miscellaneous: </h1>
        <p>other random bits of elerian life and culture that wouldn't fit anywhere else.</p>
        <h2 id="climate"> time, climate, movement of the sun and moon.</h2>
        <p> days in eleria are 24 hours long and function the same as a conventional day. these days are grouped into twenty months of twenty days (dates are usually referred to in common simply as "the seventh day of the third month," or something similar. the months are not named in any meaningful way). the sun and moon each follow the same path through the sky each day, passing directly above the hearth before dipping back below the horizon. each appears roughly the same size in the sky, and the moon is always full, there are no phases. stars are visible in the sky during the night. there are no seasons; the weather/climate/temperature does vary from day to day, but there is no real overall trend. it frequently rains in eleria, though often not for much longer than a couple hours. the current scientific understanding is that rainclouds are formed predominantly from the column of steam rising off of the hearth, and weather is generally not associated with any deity, but seen more as a scientific fact of life.  temperature depends much more on the hearth than the sun, so there is little variation in temperature from day to night, but much more variation depending on geographic location. in <a href="geography.html#ezela">ezela</a>, temperatures generally range from 20-30ºC/65-85ºF, while temperatures throughout most of eleria are between 0-20ºC/35-65ºF. in the beyond, the temperature is of course especially cold, but so far away from the hearth, the beyond is the only place where the sun actually does have a significant impact on temperature, where day temperatures are usually slightly above freezing, and night temperatures generally dip to -10ºC or -20ºC/10ºF or -10ºF.</p>
        <h2 id="festivals"> festivals</h2>
        <p> many festivals in eleria are regional, though there are a few that occur all over the region, most of which correspond to events during <a href="religion.html#the_dividing_time">the dividing time</a>. on the twentieth day of the fifteenth month, the "hearth festival" or the "guardian festival" is held in honor of ignaea's defense of the hearth during the dividing time. the main event of festivities is a tournament held in each arena around the realm with the purpose of establishing the next group of guardians. the seventeenth day of the fourth month is a festival to <a href="religion.html#clia">clia</a> and <a href="religion.html#clia">karoa</a>, meant to show clia what karoa has created and vice versa, since each is forever kept from the other. during the day, artificers and engineers display their finest creations to their friends and neighbors and hope that karoa will smile upon the influence of clia on their work, and at night, performers take to the street and sing their ballades, read their poetry, stage their plays, and in <a href="geography.html#talyen">talyen</a>, engage in karoan combat. the last day of each year begins a festival that runs into the first day of the new year that celebrates the transition of the dividing time into the era afterwards, but also celebrating the creation of the world. religious elerians spend most of the day engaged in their preferred form of worship, but it is also just a general festival, where people hold feasts and give gifts.</p>
        <h2 id="pebblerun"> pebblerun</h2>
        <p> pebblerun is a private company based in <a href="geography.html#kurrgahr">kurrgahr</a> contracted to maintain the floes, and is also often contracted for associated projects (such as waterwheels, tunnels, and bridges). while <a href="geography.html#katis">katis</a> does not have any sort of nobility, the higher-ups in pebblerun certainly imitate nobility well. most live in lavish mansions, whether above or below the surface, and all have more money than they know what to do with. some fund universities and academies, others procure rare artifacts from around the realm, and others simply sit on their money, unsure what to do with it. many officials make sure to keep their bloodline in the company, and so much of the executive board is composed of dwarves just as the company was hundreds of years ago. there are still ways for any worker in the company to prove their worth and rise in the ranks, though, so while rare, there are stories of humans, elves, and even a gnome and a tabaxi managing to break their way into upper management. the company employs roughly three thousand employees throughout the realm, and earns most of its revenue from the high council, but also earns a hefty sum from tolls charged in its tunnels used frequently to cross the floes.  </p>
        <h2 id="academics"> academics</h2>
        <p> there are a few small colleges scattered throughout eleria, though most study (both academic and arcane) takes place in one of a handful of universities. located in <a href="geography.html#kurggahr">kurggahr</a> is the grezden academy, an academic university focused primarily on the sciences founded on a donation from the grezden family (which for some time held a majority stake in pebblerun, but has now largely exited the company). there is the college of iora, located in central <a href="geography.htlm#iora">iora</a>, not particularly close to any major town or city, which has programs in just about everything, both academic and arcane. in the ioran sector of <a href="geography.html#ezela">ezela</a> lies swiftfoot university, which largely focuses on the sciences, but has small colleges focused on the arcane. the king's academy in the talyen sector of ezela is the oldest school in eleria, having relocated from <a href="geography.html#imra">imra</a> shortly after it was burned down, featuring mostly programs in the arts and humanities. lastly, tower college is located on the outskirts of ezela in the <a href="geography.html#katis_sector">katis sector</a>. it is located entirely within a single ivory tower, one of the tallest manmade structures in all of eleria. its programs are all in the arcane arts, and a majority of the great wizards of eleria train here. </p>
        <h2 id="arcane"> magic and the arcane</h2>
        <p> since veya is seen as an evil goddess by many (particularly followers of vehrti religion) in eleria's cities and towns, magic has a certain taboo aspect to it. that said, however, magic is still found nearly everywhere. it is used by the guardians of the hearth for defense, it is used in the streets of ezela for tricks and performances, it is used in the mines of <a href="geography.html#kurggahr">kurggahr</a> and in the fields of <a href="geography.html#iora">iora</a>. while the more religious inhabitants of eleria may be uncomforatble with it, few would seek to outlaw or even discourage magic's use. only within the walls of the inner city of ezela, is magic's use banned out in the open, though many temples and other religious spaces will also not tolerate exploitation of the arcane within their walls. while most of the realm's most powerful wizards study at an academy like tower college, most of those blessed with a connection to the aether will hone their powers under the tutelage of another mage as an apprentice; schooling is mostly for those with extreme potential or hefty purses. </p>
        <h2 id="travel"> geography/travel</h2>
        <p> while there is a notion of "north/south/east/west" in eleria, directions/descriptions on a larger scale are generally given in terms of "farther from/closer to the hearth" and "counterclockwise/clockwise around the hearth." most travel in the region happens for the purposes of trade, though some will move from one place to another in hopes of picking up a new profession, attending university, or for religious purposes. some wealthier individuals will even travel for fun, visiting especially beautiful or historical locations like the monasteries of <a href="geography.html#avyls">avyls</a> or the ruins of <a href="geography.html#imra">imra</a>.</p>
