        <h1> history of eleria</h1>
        <p> long ago, the people of eleria mostly lived in small nations composed of members of their own race. the most common races in eleria (elves, dwarves, and humans) largely controlled the region surrounding the hearth, while less populous groups were forced out from the region near the hearth. the area within a few miles of the hearth was largely unlivable, though: the runoff water from the melting walls of the valley aggregated and became too deep at the bottom of the valley. a few miles away, the water was shallow enough to be managed around a small city, but anywhere within twenty miles of the hearth was flooded too deep to live in. gradually, the humans, dwarves, and elves started establishing vast, permanent nations, filled with cities and villages. though the nations occasionally sparred, there were no great wars–only an uneasy peace. the dwarven nation in particular made rapid technological advantages, with machines, tools, weapons, and armor. the elven nation, seeing this progress, grew afraid that the dwarves were preparing for war, and so they built a wall to keep out attackers from the dwarven nation. fearing that the elves' wall was in turn a preparation for war against them, the dwarves put up their own wall surrounding their society.</p>
        <p> due to the shape of the walls that were constructed, the usually uniform flow of water through the two regions was funneled inwards, keeping the flow out of parts of each region and concentrating it into a river between the two. this was initially seen as a positive for each of the nations, but they each quickly realized that they now had no easy way to travel from one nation to the other without traversing through human territory or the beyond.</p>
        <p>a tabaxi from the near beyond, jade swiftfoot, noticed the effects of the construction projects and had an idea. she travelled first to the dwarves to draw up plans, and then as an experienced traveller of the beyond, served as a messenger between the dwarves and the elves. she arranged a plan to extend the walls far out into the beyond, and build them up to be able to handle stronger flows of water. in exchange, the elves and dwarves would provide provisions and materials to jade and the employees she would go on to hire, and a final payment of gold and land to all who contributed. the end result would be a powerful river near the hearth that could be used to power machinery, and dry land elsewhere, so society could expand both closer to and farther from the hearth. for fourteen years, jade and a team of two hundred other workers worked to construct the walls of what would eventually become the first floe.</p>
        <p> upon conclusion of the construction, jade marched with her workers into the ancient city of <a href="geography.html#imra">imra</a>, the capital of the elven society, to receive payment. upon entering the city, however, the team was stopped at the gate to the palace. the king of the elven society had decided to back out of the original agreement, and would not pay for his half of the construction. jade, as an older tabaxi, used to a lifetime of belittlement and prejudice from the elves, held a brief argument with the guards, but soon left with her higher-up officers, her head hung in shame.</p>
        <p> a team of sixty or so workers stayed behind however, and took their revenge. when night fell, they set fire to the city, burning a portion of the palace and much of the surrounding area to the ground, killing thousands, and permanently upsetting the physical and political structure of the city. a large portion of the group was arrested, imprisoned, and eventually executed, but it is generally believed that a minority of the group eventually escaped back to the beyond.</p>
        <p> jade marched with the remainder of her workers around the new floe to <a href="geography.html#kurggahr">kurggahr</a>, not yet having heard about the fire, and was met there with more respect. she and her officers were compensated handsomely for their work, and many among the group settled down and began work as artificers and engineers. the workers lower down on the totem pole, however, had fewer skills and received less pay. to make ends meet, a majority of them began work in the mines deep below, but quickly found that they were poorly equipped to handle life and work underground, compared to the dwarves. while some of the group stayed, within fifty years, a majority of the workers had fled to iroa to live simpler lives aboveground, creating the many groups that still exist today of tabaxi, dragonborn, aarakocra, and many others farming and telling their stories. </p>
        <p> for the dwarves' good treatment of her and her team, jade shared the plans she used to build the beginnings of the floes with dwarvish royalty and many other engineers. while she had no more plans to work on them, she saw the potential that they could have for all inhabitants of eleria, and so she encouraged others to continue work on them. teams of dwarven engineers (including the group that would eventually become <a href="misc.html#pebblerun">pebblerun</a>) took up the task, expanding the walls out farther into the beyond, digging trenches to have the surface of the floes even with the ground, rather than raised above it, and instituting a variety of structural improvements to ensure they could last much longer. these dwarves also began work on what have since become the other two floes, working out contracts with nobles in iora and the elven region, which by then had taken the modern form of <a href="geography.html#talyen">talyen</a>. </p>
        <p> with the construction of the floes, the regions were brought together over a common cause, but also geographically divided. securing a deal to build tunnels under each of the floes near the hearth earned pebblerun the notoriety that they still hold today, but also made living close to the hearth especially attractive. with no more worries about runoff flooding homes near the hearth, and the added benefit of easy access to the other regions, many peasants flocked inwards, hoping to build a better life in a new trade hotspot. homes, businesses, temples, and academies were erected, and so inhabitants from all over eleria were brought closer together than they had been for centuries. </p>
        <p> an agreed upon need to defend the city and the hearth beyond the small forces that each region had rallied led to the creation of the ezelan government–the high council–and as ezela's size and power have grown, the high council has become the de facto ruling power throughout eleria. regional and local monarchies/governments held power then as they still do today, but this transition of power from the hands of the regions to the hands of the high council marks the beginning of the modern era.</p>
        
<!--        the rest of the workers are with jade, turned away in the dwarven area but jade and the main officers are allowed in for their engineering prowess or something like that? maybe they're all allowed in. who knows. some go back to the beyond, warn future generations about the cities close to the hearth, and grow resentful, but some still head south.-->
