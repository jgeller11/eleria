        <h1> guardians and the hearth:</h1>
        <h1 id="guardians"> guardians</h1>
        <p> the guardians are a strange combination of a police system and a standing militia. while there is no "army" in eleria, since there is no other nation against which to fight, the guardians as an instution are awfully similar to one. while many guardians serve as officers to control crime and enforce the law in smaller towns and cities, many others occupy wardstone, a fortress surrounding the hearth on all sides, meant to protect it at all costs from any who would seek to tamper with it.</p>
        <h2 id="pits">selection</h2>
        <p>the guardian selection process is rigorous and ceremonial. dozens of fighting pits/arenas can be found throughout eleria, particularly in <a href="geography.html#talyen">talyen</a>. each year, on the twentieth day of the fifteenth month (in commemoration of <a href="religion.html#ignaea">ignaea</a>'s defense of <a href="guardians.html#the_hearth">the hearth</a> during <a href="religion.html#the_dividing_time">the dividing time</a>), a festival is held in honor of the first defense of the hearth. at this festival, each town with a fighting pit holds a tournament, and victors of these tournaments are inducted as new guardians. </p>
        <h2 id="hierarchy">hierarchy</h2>
        <p>all new guardians are inducted at the rank of class i. class i guardians are all essentially police officers at a local level, usually covering a very small section of a large city, or a small village, with a team of a few other class i's. class ii guardians generally command these groups of class i guardians, so there will be one class ii guardian assigned to each small village or neighborhood of a city. upon promotion to class iii, guardians have the option to begin work in wardstone to protect the hearth, or to become a commander of a larger region, usually with a dozen or so class ii guardians under them. a vast majority of class iv guardians work within wardstone with their own team of class iii's, though the eight that don't operate large regions of eleria. finally, there are at all times seven class v guardians that form a council in wardstone for managing the force.</p>
        <h2 id="wardstone"> wardstone fortress</h2>
        <p> wardstone fortress is a massive structure that surrounds the hearth and extends away from it for half a mile. the inside is essentially a functional civilization with stores, temples and living accomodations. guardians are allowed to leave the fortress, but it is generally inconvenient to live outside, so many will only leave once or twice a year at most to visit family. while inside wardstone, guardians are under close watch from their superiors to ensure that they are prepared to defend and not plotting to conspire with an attacker.</p>
        <p> attacks on wardstone do occur, though rarely are they of a particularly high threat level. small teams of delinquents often try to ride through wardstone on the floes, but they are picked off as soon as they reach the gates, and no one is really sure what they would do if they reached the hearth, anyway. ultimately, few guardians actually fight much while they guard the hearth in wardstone, but most in eleria believe that wardstone's presence is the reason there are no large scale attacks.</p>
        <h1 id="the_hearth"> the hearth</h1>
        <p> the hearth is older than the gods, and as old as the universe. a magical flame nearly a mile in diameter, the hearth is of unknown origin and function, but to an elerian, asking why the hearth burns is as abstract of a question as asking why the sun glows or why ice melts. in eleria, the hearth is just a fact of life that need not be questioned.</p>
        <p> more than it <i> need</i> not be questioned, though, the hearth <i>may</i> not be questioned. study of the hearth in any form is strictly prohibited by all academies and the high council, out of fear that study of the hearth is carried out with the intention of extinguishing it. even someone pure of heart could conduct research that would one day lead to an evildoer launching an attack on the hearth, extinguishing the heart of eleria, and taking down the whole realm with it.</p>
        <p> in modern history, few have even set eyes upon the hearth. it is surrounded on all sides by wardstone, and its existence may only be indirectly observed from the column of steam above it and the warming temperature as you approach it. those found to be studying the hearth at an institute of study are reported and expelled from the school, and depending on the nature of the study, may be tried in court and given much harsher punishment. </p>
