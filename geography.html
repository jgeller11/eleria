        <h1> geography of eleria</h1>
        <p> the geography of eleria is predominantly defined in terms of the three manmade floes, and the three regions the floes divide them into. at the confluence of the floes surrounding the hearth lies ezela, an urban metropolis far larger than any other in eleria, both the geographical and cultural center of the world. outside of the valley eleria sits in, there is nothing. far in the past, when the valley was shallower, some would manage to venture out, but find only a flat expanse of ice. now, scaling the walls of the valley is a nearly impossible task without powerful magic, and the few mages who may be able to achieve such a feat consider it a waste of time, since it is consensus that there is simply nothing to see.</p>
        <h1 id="regions"> regions</h1>
        <h2 id="katis"> katis (KAH-tis)</h2>
        <p> the geographically smallest of the three regions, katis is predominantly the home of the industrial. most people live either underground in subterranean cities that also serve as constant mining operations, or in densely populated villages and cities aboveground filled with workshops and forges. while a majority of the population of katis is composed of dwarves, the region is fairly diverse, especially close to ezela and very far away from it. while there are small farms, large-scale agriculture in katis is difficult, due to occasional collapses in the mines below destroying farmland. small plots of land can be sectioned off as unmineable territory for the villages and cities that do exist aboveground, but sectioning off thousands of acres for farmland is economically unfeasible, when considering the riches that lie below.</p>
        <p> as one might expect in a mining region, <a href="religion.html#terra">terra</a> is particularly popular in katis, and is worshipped by all who search for gems and ores deep below. <a href="religion.html#clia">clia</a>, as the patron of invention and ingenuity, has a strong following in the aboveground academies and workshops. in general, <a href="religion.html#azum">azum</a> is the most popular form of worship. katis's largest city and capital is <a href="geography.html#kurrgahr">kurrgahr</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="talyen"> talyen (TALL-yen)</h2>
        <p> talyen is the most traditional of the three regions. it is on its quarter that civilization began, and so it is a religious and historically fascinating region. while, like in all the regions, people of all races are present, talyen is almost entirely composed of elves (not including those living within ezela). most of the land away from the hearth is a preserved wilderness, populated with beautiful trees, magnificent beasts, and numerous small villages, monasteries, and temples. </p>
        <p> with their love of tradition, however, comes a love of the greatest elerian tradition of all: combat. talyen is home to more arenas than the rest of eleria combined, and they see frequent use. nearly every festival, whether secular or religious, is an excuse for a ceremonial fight, and a plurality of guardians are raised and trained in the wilderness of talyen <a href="religion.html#karoa">karoa</a> and <a href="religion.html#ignaea">ignaea</a> both possess a strong following as patrons of combat in all its forms, and nearly all inhabitants of talyen are <a href="religion.html#vehrti">vehrti</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="iora"> iora (eye-OR-uh)</h2>
        <p> the geographically largest region, iora is composed almost entirely of farmland. the farmers of iora make up a majority of the population, and produce a majority of the grain in the realm. there are timberlands throughout the region, though many of these are merely lumber farms, and not the picturesque forests of talyen. </p>
        <p> iora has by far the most diverse population. while people of all races in eleria can be found anywhere, especially in the beyond or in ezela, it is much more difficult to find people of many races in any meaningful quantity outside of ezela in talyen or katis than in iora. a plurality of the population is composed of humans, but it is easy to find elves, dwarves, gnomes, and others just about anywhere in iora. <a href="religion.html#satya">satya</a> is commonly worshipped as a harvest god, though the people of iora are generally far less devout than in other regions, and do not overwhelmingly follow any particular sect. fleeing religious persecution that is uncommon but present in other regions, many scholars of the arcane arts relocate to iora to pursue their studies, but <a href="veya">veya's</a> following is still sparse, as in other regions.</p>
        <h2 id="the_beyond"> the beyond</h2>
        <p> the beyond is a vaguely defined region that roughly encompasses everywhere more than a few hundred miles away from the hearth. it is sparsely populated, and mostly a barren wasteland. due to the shape of the valley eleria sits in, the beyond is sloped towards the hearth, and spends most of each day in the shadow cast by the valley walls. it is known that mystical beasts sent by <a href="religion.html#satya">satya</a> approach from the beyond, since parties of goblins or orcs occasionally reach the farms and villages, but there are legends of much larger and stranger beasts that are difficult to verify or disprove for those that live closer to the hearth.</p>
        <p> the beyond stretches out past all three regions, though all sections of the beyond more or less share the same culture and demographics. the religion in the beyond is far more shamanic and primitive, with many chants, rituals, and sacrifices.  the beyond is the only place where worship of <a href="religion.html#veya">veya</a> is common: <a href="religion.html#clia">clia</a> and <a href="religion.html#karoa">karoa</a> hide from the beyond for most of each day, <a href="religion.html#ignaea">ignaea</a>'s warmth cannot be felt, <a href="religion.html#terra">terra</a>'s earth is cold and unforgiving, and satya sends only horrors, but the aether is accessible to all in the beyond, and some claim that its power is even more powerful there. not much is known about the inhabitants of the beyond or how they survive: some claim that the guardians secretly bring them payments of food for keeping satya's beasts at bay, others say they feast upon the flesh of those very same beasts. whatever the explanation may be, though, those in the beyond are generally isolated, and cut off from the rest of eleria. occasionally, some will work in the beyond to maintain the structure of the floes as the ground beneath it melts, but the floes are not much more than half an inch deep at most points in the beyond, so maintenance is simple and often completely unnecessary.</p>
        <h1 id="floes">the floes</h1>
        <p> the floes are manmade structures that direct the water from the melting ice throughout eleria into more useful channels. far away from the hearth, the water is only an inch or two deep, and so simple stone walls are enough to contain the floes. as the water is channeled inwards, however, the floes grow deeper and move faster, so closer to the city, the floes are set into pits in the bedrock. as they flow into the hearth, the water evaporates, and rises above the city in a massive pillar of steam.</p>
        <p> the floes fulfill an unusual role in eleria. they are necessary as a protective measure, ensuring that the melting ice from the walls of the valley do not form a persistent tidal wave rushing through ezela, but the floes also serve many practical purposes. within a hundred or so miles of the hearth, the floes are deep enough to support small rafts travelling to ezela for trade, though of course they only go one way. a common practice for farmers is to form a small raft out of logs to carry goods, sell the goods as well as the logs that form the raft in or near ezela, and then return home on foot. the largest workshops in and near ezela often exploit the floes to power machinery, and farms near the floes commonly pull small streams from them for irrigation purposes. the floes are maintained by pebblerun, a massive company contracted by the government primarily for that very purpose, headquartered in <a href="geography.html#kurggahr">kurggahr</a></p>
        <p> crossing the floes has historically been very difficult. originally created partially as a way of dividing up the land to reduce conflict, there was never a plan for an easy way to get from one region to another. for many years, the main feasible methods were either to travel very far away from the hearth, where the waters were shallow and calm enough to cross on foot, or to travel very close to the hearth, where the floes were narrow enough that building a tunnel beneath them was feasible. however, in the past hundred or so years, engineering advances have enabled artificers from <a href="geography.html#katis">katis</a> to build tunnels below the floes farther away from the hearth, and work has even begun on bridges across the floes within ezela.</p>
        <p> the floes are a masterwork of engineering, and so maintaining them and their associated infrastructure takes thousands of artificers and mages scattered throughout the realm. this job's importance cannot be overstated, so those that work on the floes are often handsomely compensated for their efforts.</p>
        <h1 id="ezela">ezela (eh-ZAY-luh)</h1>
        <p> ezela is in every way the center of eleria. a sprawling metropolis that begins roughly a mile from the hearth, and continues outwards for nearly two more, the city is home to three hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, at the time of the last census. the city is sharply divided into thirds by the floes, which are raging rivers so close to the hearth. crossing the floes is predominantly possible through tunnels which run beneath them, though these tunnels all either lie within the nearly inaccessible inner city, or require payment to use, so most born within one sector of the city will live their entire lives there. the sectors each take their names from the geographical regions they lie within, but not necessarily their cultures (though there are many similarities). </p>
        <h2 id="ioran_sector"> ioran sector</h2>
        <p> the ioran sector is likely the poorest area of ezela, though it is notable for not having an inner city. while the katis and talyen sectors both have some form of a walled off area at the center of the city, anyone can walk right up to the gates of <a href="guardians.html#wardstone">wardstone</a> in the ioran sector. the streets of the ioran sector are filled with many small businesses, whether they be taverns, inns, farmstands stocked by travellers from farther away from the hearth, or general stores. the ioran sector is also the seat of the high council, which meets in a large, but not especially opulent hall slightly outside wardstone.</p>
        <p> there are small temples raised to the gods throughout the sector, but none are particularly large–they mostly serve smaller neighborhoods of the sector. bare-bones fighting arenas are common, since being inducted as a guardian is considered by many to be the quickest way out of poverty within the sector. the fights often extend outside the arenas, however, and so the ioran sector is riddled with crime. brash but hopeful younglings quarrel in the streets, and thieves take advantage of the commotion to earn their living. some organized groups will even intentionally cause spectacles in the streets, enabling others from the syndicate to loot nearby shops and pick the pockets of any unusually wealthy passerbys. those who shy away from a life of crime live their lives in fear of those who do not.</p>
        
        <h2 id="katis_sector"> katis sector</h2>
        <p> the katis sector is dominated by temples which surround the walls to the inner city. palatial monuments to the gods are consistently filled up with devotees of <a href="religion.html#azum">azum</a> religion, who come to worship in congregations of thousands each and every day. when not involved in prayer, however, the inhabitants of the katis sector tend to be fairly well-off in comparison to the average ezelan. nearly half are educated and work in the trades, compared with closer to a quarter in the talyen sector and about 15% of the ioran sector. </p>
        <p> there are of course taverns and general stores, but much of the space in the streets is filled with artificers' workshops, blacksmiths' forges, and armories stocked by craftsmen living outside the city. the most popular shops, however, deal in the arcane. with the wealth of the katis sector comes a demand for the highest quality weapons, armor, and equipment, as well as requests for assistance from those touched by <a href="religion.html#veya">veya</a>. whether it be someone hoping to equip their personal guards, or someone simply hoping to give their child an edge in the arena, there has always been a demand for these items, and there always will be. mages gifted in the arts of enchantment commonly move to the katis sector to take advantage of the wealth, and while some set up their shops in the inner city, hoping to find the wealthiest patrons, many others sell their (slightly lower-quality) goods and services just outside the gates. </p>
        
        <h2 id="talyen_sector"> talyen sector</h2>
        <p> filled with inhabitants of talyen who didn't appreciate their previous life among the trees, the talyen sector is as bohemian as anywhere in eleria, with street performers blocking the entrances to theatres and galleries, and graffiti murals covering every wall. while there is a lot of nonsense here, it is also the undeniable cradle of the arts in eleria. wealthier store owners from the other sectors often save up until they can afford to move themselves, their families, their businesses, and their lives to the talyen sector, where they can run their tavern, inn, or general store in the same capacity, but witness the greatest masterpieces eleria has to offer in their free time. </p>
        <p> though there is an abundance of talent in the talyen sector, there is not an abundance of wealth. many young people rely on the help of their temples while they try to make it big, or hold other considerably less performative jobs to support them while they search for opportunities to do what they love. the occasional bard is spotted by a noble on vacation, and invited into the inner city to be a regular performer at a tavern or hall within, but most will live their lives performing on the streets for copper pieces, and couldn't be any happier.</p>
        
        <h2 id="inner_city"> the inner city</h2>
        <p> both the talyen and katis sectors contain a walled off portion of the city that surrounds wardstone and extends outwards from it for about half a mile. the walls to the inner city are guarded sometimes by guardians, and sometimes by private guards hired by those that live in the inner city. only those that live or work within are allowed passage, unless accompanied by someone else with access. magic is strictly forbidden in the streets of either sector's inner city, and streets are heavily patrolled, making the inner city by far the safest part of any sector of ezela. not much is known to the general public about the area, other than that just about anyone who lives there is incredibly wealthy, and has no real reason to leave. a tunnel connecting the talyen and katis inner cities together beneath the floe that divides them is the easiest way to cross any floe anywhere in eleria, but by virtue of its positioning, it is only accessible to the rich and powerful. though those from outside the inner city often attempt to sneak in, such attempts are rarely successful, and are met with swift and harsh punishment. </p>
        
        <h1> list of some other notable towns/cities</h1>
        <h2 id="kurrgahr"> kurggahr (CURR-garr)</h2>
<!--        headquarters of the gov't business that manages the floes, lots of well-known smiths and artificers, a college of artifice, etc.-->
        <p> kurggahr is the second-largest city in eleria after ezela, with a population of a little over a hundred thousand. it can be found roughly 100 miles away from the hearth in katis, more or less equidistant from the two floes. it is a large city aboveground, but it is far more expansive below the surface. </p>
        <p> the aboveground part of kurrgahr is very much the face of the city. land is pricey, and just about all trade, tourism, and travel begins and ends here. many artisan blacksmiths and mechanics work here, each attempting to earn a name in the industry to secure more expensive jobs from the many wealthy individuals that travel to kurrgahr for a high-quality tinkerer. the three most notable sights to see in kurrgahr would likely be the <a href="misc.html#academics">grezden academy</a>, the primary competitor to swiftfoot academy in ezela, the physically largest temple in eleria (raised in honor of <a href="religion.html#clia">clia</a>), and the headquarters of <a href="misc.html#pebblerun">pebblerun</a>, the company contracted by the high council to build and maintain the floes. </p>
        <p> the subterranean sector of kurrgahr is, on the other hand, a gritty, crowded, sprawling city. the peasantry and peons of kurrgahr primarily work as miners for one of a handful of large firms. as these companies dig farther and farther into the bedrock, the caverns left behind are filled in with new residents, and so the city grows. there is not much reason to visit subterranean kurrgahr, as most companies will bring their ore and gems to the surface to sell, and travellers will likely not find much to do here for fun, anyway: most residents exclusively speak dwarvish, and there aren't many inns set up to accomodate visitors.</p> 
        <h2 id="avyls"> avyls (AH-veels)</h2>
        <p> avyls is not exactly a large city, but it is the second-largest in talyen, and it holds great cultural and religious significance. when the first civilization's foundations began to melt from beneath them, the elves who previously lived there took it as a sign from <a href="religion.html#ignaea">ignaea</a> that they were to move farther away from the hearth. as the legend goes, a colony of thousands of elves moved away from the hearth one step at a time, laying down soil, planting a forest, and living off of the land they created. when they travelled far enough that the trees would no longer grow, they settled down and established what has now become avyls at the edge of the beyond.</p>
        <p> the city is largely self-sufficient and isolated economically speaking–there are few exports and imports–but many people from all over eleria move to the city seeking spiritual guidance. surrounding avyls in a hexagonal shape are six monasteries constructed early in the town's life, each devoted to a different <a href="religion.html#gods">god</a>. at the age of 15, a child growing up in avyls is brought before a council composed of members of each monastery to have their future decided for them. if the council deems the child fit to serve the gods, then they will be inducted into the monastery that the council believes matches the child best. if the child is not deemed capable, then they remain in the city as a peasant, farming and working to raise the next generation of hopeful monks.</p>
        <p> as its origin story suggests, avyls lies at an unusual place, with beautiful forests as far as the eye can see looking towards the hearth, but a cold, icy wasteland looking towards the wall of the valley: avyls is the frontier.</p>
        <h2> imra (IHM-ruh)</h2>
        <p> imra lies in <a href="geography.html#talyen">talyen</a> in the midst of the forest. it is a spot where many of the elves venturing to establish avyls decided to end their journey early, and it grew into the seat of power in ancient talyen. a palace there was the home of the elvish monarch until followers of jade swiftfoot (see <a href="history.html">history of eleria</a>) burnt a majority of it to the ground. the burning of imra significantly diminished its status as one of the wealthiest and most developed cities throughout eleria, though its large population remained. with many of the artisans, nobles, and other wealthy members of the city's homes being targeted, however, little wealth remained in imra. the monarchy lost its credibility and power, though the poverty remained, and a new nobility eventually rose again. imra still exists today, but it has dwindled from its once monstrous size as most inhabitants of talyen have begun to spread out across the region, though the city remains as a monument to a society that once was, and still serves as the seat of the talyen government.</p>
        
        <h2 id="gloughton"> gloughton (GLAU-ton)</h2>
        <p> notable almost purely for its status as the capital of <a href="geography.html#iora">iora</a>, gloughton doesn't have a whole lot going on. it is a small town with all the essentials and not much else. it is more or less similar to any other town in the region, serving as a center for local trade, and a place to seek slightly more obscure services like a mage or a doctor in the sparsely populated fields of iora. it is home to a meeting hall for the few representatives that make the local laws and taxes of iora, though the regional government holds little power and has no plans to change that, so this is only barely notable. most inhabitants of gloughton are farmers, and most of the land of gloughton is farmland.</p>
        
        <h2 id="greattree"> greattree (GREAT-tree)</h2>
        <p> greattree would not reasonably be considered a city anywhere else in eleria, but even its small population seems to make it a metropolis amid the emptiness of the beyond. technically lying in talyen, it is difficult to say greattree really belongs to any of the three regions, since it lies farther away from the hearth than the floes extend. greattree is a village kept alive by magic and perserverance, surrounding its namesake super-sized sycamore which towers over the village, and surrounded by stone walls meant to keep <a href="religion.html#satya">satya</a>'s horrors at bay. most in greattree serve as part of a standing militia to protect against the hordes of orcs, goblins, and others that continually terrorize them, though they all still hold jobs elsewhere, usually contributing to the production of food, armor, or weapons in some way. the shamans of the beyond keep the city alive, producing the heat and water with which to grow crops and survive. the people of greattree are hardy folk, as are most in the beyond, and their survival is a testament to the power of the arcane and of the gods.</p>
        
        <h2 id="portswood"> portswood (PORTS-wood)</h2>
        <p> there are really only a few things that set portswood apart from any other random town in <a href="geography.html#iora">iora</a>: a fighting pit, a powerful wizard that lives off in the woods nearby, and the fact that the campaign begins here. there are all the conventional essentials you might expect; a general store, a couple taverns, a small temple to ignaea (but more generally for all the gods, since the area around portswood isn't big enough to support six different temples), and some smaller shops. portswood lies roughly 40 miles from ezela along the bank of the floe that divides iora from katis. there is a nearly finished construction project to connect portswood to katis via a tunnel beneath the floe, which inhabitants of portswood hope will turn it into a trade hotspot, though currently its best source of trade is a small port for receiving rafts from upstream and sending rafts down to ezela.</p>
<!--        the one where the adventure starts, you know the one. there's a mysterious old wizard/mage who lives outside the town, sells some rare spell components through his apprentice, which is the main reason to visit. it is also the nearest fighting pit for many in the human region, because there generally aren't as many there. -->
